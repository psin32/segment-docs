[Elastic Path](https://www.elasticpath.com?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners){:target="_blank"} is a SaaS based headless commerce platform that provides core commerce with a focus on catalog and product data management and modern merchandising capabilities so that brands can power their complex commerce experiences across multiple geographies, touchpoints, brands, and business models.

This is an [Event Cloud Source](/docs/sources/#event-cloud-sources){:target="_blank"} which can not only export data into your Segment warehouse, but can also federate the exported data into your other enabled Segment Destinations.

This source is maintained by Elastic Path. For any issues with the source, contact the [Elastic Path Support team](https://support.elasticpath.com/hc/en-us){:target="_blank"}.

_**NOTE:** The Elastic Path Source is currently in beta, which means that they are still actively developing the source. If you are interested in joining their beta program or have any feedback to help improve the Elastic Path Source and its documentation, [let the Elastic Path team know](https://support.elasticpath.com/hc/en-us)._

## Getting started

1. Navigate to **Connections > Catalog** and make sure you're on the **Sources** tab of the catalog.
2. Search for **Elastic Path** in the Sources Catalog, select **Elastic Path**, and click **Add Source**.
3. Give the Source a name and configure any other settings.
    - The name identifies this source within your workspace, and typically reflects the name of the application. The name can be anything, but Segment recommends that you use something that reflects the source itself and distinguishes amongst your environments (for example, `SourceName_Prod`, `SourceName_Staging`, or `SourceName_Dev`).
4. Click **Add Source** to save your settings.
5. Copy the Write key from the Segment UI and log in to the Elastic Path Commerce Manager.  
6. Navigate to Integrations Hub > Select Segment integration > [configure integration](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/composer/integration-hub/customer-management/segment){:target="_blank"} where you need to use Segment key.

This integration uses JSONata templates to provide flexibility to send your custom fields to Segment.

You can configure how you want to associate an Elastic Path event with Segment event for streaming data. For example, send the `Order Completed` event to Segment when the Elastic Path order event is `order.paid` or `order.authorized` or if order is fulfilled, for example, `order.fulfilled`.

## Stream

Elastic Path uses our stream Source component to send Segment event data. It uses a server-side (select from `track`, `identify`, `page`, `group`) method(s) to send data to Segment. These events are then available in any destination that accepts server-side events, and available in a schema in your data warehouse, so you can query using SQL.

The default behavior is for Elastic Path to pass the customerId associated with the order as the userId. There are cases in which Elastic Path does not have an associated customerId e.g. in case of guest order, in which case the email address will be passed in as the anonymousId or you can configure any random id as well.

## Events

The table below lists events that Elastic Path sends to Segment. These events appear as tables in your warehouse, and as regular events in other Destinations.

Note: Elastic path uses properties of these events from the [eCommerce Spec](/docs/connections/spec/ecommerce/v2){:target="_blank"} defined by the Segment doc. Add more properties as per this documentation based on your business requirement.

## Add destinations

After you configure your source, you can connect it with destinations. Log in to your downstream tools and check to see that your events appear as expected, and that they contain all of the properties you expect. If your events and properties donâ€™t appear, check the Event Delivery tool, and refer to the destination docs for each tool for troubleshooting. If there are any issues with how the events arrive to Segment, contact the [Elastic Path Support team](https://support.elasticpath.com/hc/en-us){:target="_blank"}.
